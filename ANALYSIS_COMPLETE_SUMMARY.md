## 🎯 Key Findings

### All Missing Functionality by Tier

| Tier | Category | Gap | Hours | Impact |
|------|----------|-----|-------|--------|
| **🔴 Tier 1** | Critical | 7 items | 236-284h | Blocks safety/operations |
| **🟠 Tier 2** | High | 8 items | 257-323h | Blocks compliance |
| **🟡 Tier 3** | Medium | 8 items | 220-295h | Improves capabilities |
| **🟢 Tier 4** | Low | 6 items | 135-175h | Nice-to-have features |
| **TOTAL** | | **29 gaps** | **620-694h** | Production ready |

### Critical Issues (Must Fix First)
1. **Terrain Database Stub** - TAWS non-functional (40-60h)
2. **95% Code Untested** - No automated validation (200+h)
3. **No Input Validation** - Accepts garbage data (20-30h)
4. **Antimeridian Routing** - Fails near date line (8h)
5. **SimConnect Error** - Crashes on disconnect (8-12h)

### Quick Wins
- Antimeridian handling: 5-8 hours
- SimConnect reconnection: 8-10 hours
- Configuration system: 15-20 hours
- Test framework setup: 8-10 hours
