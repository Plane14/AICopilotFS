## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced State Feature Extraction (`extractStateFeatures()`)

**Total Features: 10 normalized features**

#### Feature Vector Breakdown:

| Index | Feature | Range | Normalization | Purpose |
|-------|---------|-------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Altitude | 0-50,000 ft | altitude / 50000 | Height above sea level |
| 2 | Indicated Airspeed (IAS) | 0-400 knots | IAS / 400 | Aircraft speed through air |
| 3 | Ground Speed (GS) | 0-500 knots | GS / 500 | Aircraft speed over ground |
| 4 | Vertical Speed (VS) | -5000 to +5000 fpm | (VS + 5000) / 10000 | Rate of altitude change |
| 5 | Bank Angle | -90 to +90° | (bank + 90) / 180 | Wing tilt from level |
| 6 | Pitch Angle | -90 to +90° | (pitch + 90) / 180 | Nose up/down from level |
| 7 | Heading (sin) | -180° to +180° | sin(heading × π/180) | Heading circular component |
| 8 | Heading (cos) | -180° to +180° | cos(heading × π/180) | Heading circular component |
| 9 | Flaps Position | 0-100% | flapsPosition / 100 | Flap deployment state |
| 10 | On Ground | Binary | 1.0 if on ground | Landing gear contact flag |

#### Key Features:

✅ **Heading Representation**: Uses sin/cos components instead of raw degrees
- Solves circular continuity problem (0° = 360°)
- Improves neural network learning
- Prevents artificial discontinuities

✅ **All Features Normalized to [0, 1]**
- Prevents scale bias in neural networks
- Improves gradient descent convergence
- Faster learning rates
- Better weight initialization

✅ **Bounds Checking**
- All values clamped to valid ranges using `std::max()` and `std::min()`
- Prevents numerical instability

#### Code Example:
```cpp
// Heading encoded as sin/cos components for circular continuity
double headingRad = state.heading * M_PI / 180.0;
double headingSin = std::sin(headingRad);  // Range: [-1, 1]
double headingCos = std::cos(headingRad);  // Range: [-1, 1]
features.push_back(headingSin);
features.push_back(headingCos);
```

### 2. Enhanced Phase Feature Extraction (`extractPhaseFeatures()`)

**Feature Vector Size: 10 elements (one per flight phase)**

#### Phase Encoding with Neighbors:

```
FlightPhase enum values (10 total):
0: PREFLIGHT
1: TAXI_OUT
2: TAKEOFF
3: CLIMB
4: CRUISE
5: DESCENT
6: APPROACH
7: LANDING
8: TAXI_IN
9: SHUTDOWN
```

#### Encoding Strategy:

| Scenario | Encoding | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| At phase X | phase[X] = 1.0 | Primary phase indicator |
| At phase X | phase[X-1] = 0.5 | Neighbor before (if exists) |
| At phase X | phase[X+1] = 0.5 | Neighbor after (if exists) |
| Other phases | 0.0 | No contribution |

#### Benefits:

✅ **Smoother Transitions**
- Reduces phase boundary artifacts
- Creates smooth gradients for backpropagation
- Helps model understand phase continuity

✅ **Example Encoding**
```
At TAKEOFF (phase index 2):
features = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
           [PRE  TAXI TKOF CLIM CRUI DESC APPR LAND TXIN SHUT]
```

✅ **Prevents Sharp Transitions**
- Old method: Switching from 0→1 at phase boundary causes gradient spikes
- New method: Gradual ramp-up in neighboring phases

### 3. Enhanced Similarity Calculation (`calculateSimilarity()`)

**Algorithm**: Feature-based Euclidean distance with exponential mapping

#### Calculation Steps:

**Step 1: Extract Features**
```
features1 = extractFeatures(context1)  // 20 elements: 10 phase + 10 state
features2 = extractFeatures(context2)  // 20 elements: 10 phase + 10 state
```

**Step 2: Calculate Euclidean Distance**
```cpp
distance = √(Σ(features1[i] - features2[i])²)
```

**Step 3: Convert to Feature Similarity**
```
featureSimilarity = exp(-distance)
```

Distance mapping:
- distance = 0 → similarity = 1.0 (identical)
- distance = 1 → similarity ≈ 0.368
- distance = 2 → similarity ≈ 0.135
- distance = 3 → similarity ≈ 0.050

**Step 4: Calculate Phase Similarity**
```
phaseSimilarity = (c1.phase == c2.phase) ? 1.0 : 0.0
```

**Step 5: Combine Similarities**
```
combinedSimilarity = 0.7 * featureSimilarity + 0.3 * phaseSimilarity
```

#### Weight Rationale:

| Weight | Component | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| 0.7 | Feature Similarity | Captures detailed state differences |
| 0.3 | Phase Similarity | Ensures training data is phase-relevant |

#### Output Ranges:

| Similarity | Interpretation | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| 0.9-1.0 | Identical contexts | Highly confident predictions |
| 0.7-0.9 | Very similar | Strong pattern matching |
| 0.5-0.7 | Somewhat similar | Moderate confidence |
| 0.3-0.5 | Weakly similar | Low confidence |
| 0.0-0.3 | Dissimilar | Not useful for prediction |

#### Threshold Usage:
```cpp
// In findSimilarContexts()
if (similarity > 0.7) {
    similar.push_back(data);  // Include in training set
}
```

```

### Backward Compatibility:

- Existing callers work without modification
- Enhanced internally without API changes

## Mathematical Details

### Euclidean Distance Formula

$$d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}$$

Where:
- $x_i, y_i$ = feature components (normalized to [0,1])
- $n$ = number of features (20)

### Exponential Similarity Mapping

$$s_{feature} = e^{-d}$$

Properties:
- Smooth, continuous function
- No abrupt transitions
- Asymmetric: small distances matter more
- Differentiable (useful for gradient-based learning)

### Combined Similarity

$$s_{combined} = 0.7 \times e^{-d} + 0.3 \times \mathbb{1}(phase_1 = phase_2)$$

Where:
- $\mathbb{1}$ = indicator function (1 if true, 0 if false)

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity

| Operation | Complexity | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| extractStateFeatures() | O(1) | 10 features extracted |
| extractPhaseFeatures() | O(1) | Simple array assignment |
| calculateSimilarity() | O(n) | n = 20 features |
| findSimilarContexts() | O(m×n) | m = training samples, n = 20 features |

### Memory Usage

- State features: 10 × 8 bytes = 80 bytes
- Phase features: 10 × 8 bytes = 80 bytes
- Combined features: 160 bytes per context
- Typical training data: 1000 samples × 160 bytes ≈ 160 KB

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests to Implement:

```cpp
// Test 1: Feature normalization bounds
void testFeatureNormalization() {
    // Verify all features in [0, 1]
    // Test edge cases: altitude=0, IAS=0, on ground, etc.
}

// Test 2: Similarity calculations
void testSimilarityMetric() {
    // Test identical contexts: similarity = 1.0
    // Test different phases: similarity <= 0.3
    // Test identical phase, different state
}

// Test 3: Phase encoding
void testPhaseEncoding() {
    // Verify neighbor weights for each phase
    // Test boundary phases (PREFLIGHT, SHUTDOWN)
}

// Test 4: Heading continuity
void testHeadingContinuity() {
    // Test heading 0° and 360° similarity
    // Verify sin/cos components match
}
```

---

## Tuning Parameters

The following parameters can be adjusted based on performance:

### 1. Normalization Ranges (in `extractStateFeatures()`)

```cpp
// Current values (can be tuned):
state.position.altitude / 50000.0        // Max altitude: 50k ft
state.indicatedAirspeed / 400.0          // Max IAS: 400 kts
state.groundSpeed / 500.0                // Max GS: 500 kts
(state.verticalSpeed + 5000.0) / 10000.0 // VS range: ±5000 fpm
```

Adjust these based on aircraft capabilities and typical flight regimes.

### 2. Phase Neighbor Weight (in `extractPhaseFeatures()`)

```cpp
features[phaseIndex - 1] += 0.5;  // Current neighbor weight: 0.5
features[phaseIndex + 1] += 0.5;  // Increase for smoother transitions
                                   // Decrease for sharper phase distinctions
```

### 3. Similarity Weights (in `calculateSimilarity()`)

```cpp
double combinedSimilarity = 
    0.7 * featureSimilarity +  // Feature weight: 0.7
    0.3 * phaseSimilarity;      // Phase weight: 0.3
```

Adjust based on importance of phase matching vs. state similarity.

### 4. Similarity Threshold (in `findSimilarContexts()`)

```cpp
if (similarity > 0.7) {  // Current threshold: 0.7
    similar.push_back(data);
}
```

Lower threshold: more training data used (higher recall, lower precision)
Higher threshold: fewer training data used (lower recall, higher precision)
