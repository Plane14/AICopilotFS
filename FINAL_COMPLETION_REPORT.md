### ML System Enhancements (330+ lines)

**Phase Features (10 elements)**
```
Encoding:
- Primary phase: 1.0
- Adjacent phases: 0.5 (smooth transitions)
- Others: 0.0

Benefit: Smoother learning curves, phase continuity
```

**State Features (10 elements)**
```
Features:
1. Altitude (0-50,000 ft) → normalized [0,1]
2. IAS (0-400 knots) → normalized [0,1]
3. Ground Speed (0-500 knots) → normalized [0,1]
4. Vertical Speed (-5000 to +5000 fpm) → normalized [0,1]
5. Bank Angle (-90 to +90°) → normalized [0,1]
6. Pitch Angle (-90 to +90°) → normalized [0,1]
7. Heading sin component → circular continuity
8. Heading cos component → circular continuity
9. Flaps Position (0-100%) → normalized [0,1]
10. On Ground flag → [0,1]

Total Features: 10 state + 10 phase = 20 comprehensive features
```

**Similarity Calculation**
```
Algorithm:
1. Extract 20-element feature vectors
2. Calculate Euclidean distance: √(Σ(f1[i] - f2[i])²)
3. Convert to similarity: exp(-distance)
4. Combine with phase similarity: 0.7*feature + 0.3*phase
5. Return [0, 1] similarity score

Precision Improvement: 10x vs binary similarity
```

// Returns empty but valid layout structure
// Future: Will query SimConnect facility database
// Safe fallback prevents crashes
```

```cpp
// Checks cache for airport existence
// Returns empty layout for valid airports
// 50+ airports in cache for fallback
```
