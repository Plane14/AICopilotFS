MOCK INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN
===========================

MockSimConnectWrapper:
- Inherits from SimConnectWrapper (allows substitution)
- Uses Google Mock for method mocking
- Provides state storage (aircraftState_, position_)
- Stores callbacks for manual emission
- Methods: setMockAircraftState(), emitAircraftState()

MockWeatherSystem:
- Provides weather condition injection
- Stores mock hazard database
- Methods: setMockWeather(), addMockHazard()

MockTerrainAwareness:
- Provides elevation map injection
- Stores synthetic obstacles
- Enables deterministic terrain scenarios
- Methods: setMockTerrainElevation(), addMockObstacle()

Design Principles:
- Dependency injection via constructor
- State separation (mock data vs. actual system)
- Non-invasive integration (header-only for now)
- Full callback support for async testing
