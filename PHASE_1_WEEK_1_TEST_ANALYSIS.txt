EDGE CASE TESTING STRATEGY
===========================

Navigation Edge Cases:
- Antimeridian crossing (±180° longitude)
- Polar region routing
- Zero distance calculations
- Extreme altitudes (FL430, sea level, negative MSL)
- Large flight plans (100+ waypoints)

Collision Detection Edge Cases:
- Stationary aircraft (zero velocity)
- Identical positions (guaranteed collision)
- Very close separation (within 1 foot)
- High-speed convergence (1000+ knots relative)
- Tangential encounters

Weather System Edge Cases:
- Zero wind speed
- Extreme temperatures (-50°C, +55°C)
- Out-of-range wind directions (>360°, negative)
- Extreme wind speeds (120+ knots)
- Boundary conditions (exact limits)

Terrain Awareness Edge Cases:
- Ground level positions
- Extreme MSL altitudes (43000 ft)
- Rapid descent rates (5000+ fpm)
- Mountainous terrain (>10000 ft elevation)
- Ocean positions (0 elevation)

Input Validation Strategy:
- Empty/null strings: All string parameters
- Out-of-range numbers: All numeric bounds
- Invalid coordinates: Latitude >90, longitude >180
- Negative altitudes: Should handle gracefully
- NaN/Inf values: All floating-point operations
