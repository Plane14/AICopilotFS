## Critical Implementation Standards

### Weather System
```
Required SimVars:
✓ Wind Velocity (X, Y, Z components)
✓ Ambient Temperature (°C)
✓ Precipitation State & Rate
✓ Ambient Visibility
✓ Cloud Density, Base, Top
✓ Structural Ice Accretion
✓ Ambient Turbulence

Icing Risk Formula:
  Temp in [-20°C, 0°C] AND (Precipitation OR DewPoint < 5°C diff)

Turbulence Thresholds:
  Light: 15-25 knots with wind shear
  Severe: >30 knots with high shear and downdrafts
```

### Autopilot Control Pattern
```
ALWAYS use this sequence:
  1. Set BUG (heading/altitude/speed)
  2. Enable MODE (hold)
  3. Verify STATUS (query SimVars)
  
DON'T use direct event setting for most modes
```

### ATC System
```
No direct ATC commands exist.
Instead:
  1. Subscribe to facilities
  2. Request airport list
  3. Parse frequency data
  4. Present menu to pilot/AI
  5. Transmit selection via custom event
  
This works identically on both MSFS 2024 and Prepar3D v6
```

### Terrain Integration
```
MSFS 2024 Only:
  SimConnect_RequestGroundInfo()
  Returns 64x64 elevation grid with surface normals
  
Prepar3D v6:
  Use IEnvironmentForceManagerV410
  Or query individual points via facility API
```

## Performance Baseline Expectations

| Operation | Latency | Frequency | Impact |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Weather METAR request | 10-50ms | Every 10s | Low |
| SimVar query (single) | 1-2ms | Per frame | Negligible |
| SimVar query (batch 20+) | 2-5ms | Per frame | Low |
| Event transmission | 0.5-1ms | On demand | Low |
| Facility data request | 50-200ms | Per session | Low |
| Terrain elevation (64x64) | 20-50ms | On demand | Low |
| AI aircraft creation | 100-500ms | On demand | Medium |
| Traffic detection (10km radius) | 5-10ms | Per frame | Low |

**Recommendation:** Batch requests where possible, cache facility data, use periodic polling for continuous data.
