## 🔑 Key Concepts to Remember

### 1. SimConnect API is Standardized
- Works identically on MSFS 2024 and Prepar3D v6
- 70+ events, hundreds of SimVars
- Very stable API (unlikely to break)

### 2. Two-Step Autopilot Pattern
```cpp
// Set target (bug)
SimConnect_TransmitClientEvent(..., EVENT_HEADING_BUG_SET, 300, ...);
// Enable mode (hold)
SimConnect_TransmitClientEvent(..., EVENT_AUTOPILOT_HEADING_HOLD, 1, ...);
```

### 3. ATC is Menu-Based
- No direct command API
- Subscribe to facilities
- Present menu to pilot
- Transmit selection

### 4. METAR Format is Standard
```
KJFK 121251Z 30008KT 10SM FEW250 23/14 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP201
Station Time Wind Vis Clouds Temp/Dew Altimeter Remarks
```

### 5. Icing Occurs When
- Temperature between -20°C and 0°C
- AND visible moisture (precipitation or saturation)

### 6. Ground Info API (MSFS 2024 Only)
- Provides elevation grid with surface normals
- Use for terrain analysis, obstacle detection
- Prepar3D v6 uses different approach

### 7. Extended AI Creation (Modern)
- Use _EX1 versions for livery support
- Specify airline/paint scheme
- More realistic traffic
