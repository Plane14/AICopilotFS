## Impact Assessment

### Risk Level: **HIGH** ⚠️

**Without Test Infrastructure:**
- ❌ No automated validation of critical flight systems
- ❌ Manual regression testing only → bugs slip through
- ❌ High risk of SimConnect integration failures
- ❌ Difficult to maintain code quality during refactoring
- ❌ Cannot verify emergency procedures work correctly
- ❌ Unclear which components are actually functional
- ❌ New changes can silently break existing functionality
- ❌ No CI/CD validation pipeline

### Code Quality Concerns:
```
Current state (estimated):
├── Compilation:    ✅ Works
├── Linking:        ✅ Works
├── Execution:      ⚠️ Unknown (no tests)
├── Correctness:    ❓ Untested
└── Edge Cases:     ❓ Unknown
```

                              Subtotal: 110-118 hours

Expansion Phase (Week 3-4):
  ├── Priority 2 unit tests:      75 hours
  └── Integration test framework: 20 hours
                              Subtotal: 95 hours

**Timeline:**
- **Aggressive:** 10-12 weeks (1-2 developers full-time)
- **Standard:** 14-16 weeks (1 developer at 50%)
- **Conservative:** 20+ weeks (1 developer at 25% allocation)

## Recommended Framework & Tools

### Framework: **Google Test (gtest)** ✅

**Current Status:** Already configured in project  
**Why:** 
- Industry standard in aviation/aerospace
- Excellent mock support (Google Mock)
- CI/CD integration
- Large community/documentation
- Parallel execution support

**Enhancement:** Add Google Mock (gmock) - already included with gtest

### CI/CD: **GitHub Actions**

**Workflow:**
```
Push to main
  ↓
Build Tests (Debug + Release)
  ↓
Run Unit Tests
  ↓
Generate Coverage Report
  ↓
✅ Pass = Merge approved
❌ Fail = Blocking error
```

### Coverage Tool: **gcov/lcov** (optional but recommended)

Provides visual reports showing tested vs untested code

## Questions to Address

**Q: Should we wait for tests before releasing?**  
A: No - run tests in parallel. But production release should NOT proceed without Priority 1 tests passing.

**Q: Can we do partial implementation?**  
A: Yes - Phase 1 is standalone. Can ship Phase 1 coverage and continue with later phases.

**Q: What if we find bugs in testing?**  
A: That's the goal! Tests expose bugs early. Use this to fix and prevent future regressions.

**Q: Who maintains the mocks?**  
A: Developers update mocks when interfaces change. Ideally, same team as core development.

**Q: How often should tests run?**  
A: Unit tests on every commit (CI), integration tests nightly, full suite weekly.
